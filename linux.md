Difference Between Linux & WIndows.

Linux 

Linux is a open source operating system.	

Linux is free of cost.	

It’s file name case-sensitive.

In linux, monolithic kernel is used.

Linux is more efficient in comparison of windows.	

There is forward slash is used for Separating the directories.	

Linux provides more security than windows.	

Linux is widely used in hacking purpose based systems.	

There are 3 types of user account – 

(1) Regular , (2) Root , (3) Service account

Root user is the super user and has all administrative privileges.	

Linux file naming convention in case sensitive. Thus, sample and SAMPLE are 2 different files in Linux/Unix operating system.

Windows

While windows are the not the open source operating system.

While it is costly.

While it’s file name is case-insensitive.

While in this, hybrid kernel is used.

While windows are less efficient.

While there is back slash is used for Separating the directories

While it provides less security than linux.

While windows does not provide much efficiency in hacking.

There are 4 types of user account – 

(1) Administrator , (2) Standard , (3) Child , (4) Guest

Features of Linux OS ?

Multiuser capability: Multiple users can access the same system resources like memory, hard disk, etc. But they have to use different terminals to operate.

Multitasking: More than one function can be performed simultaneously by dividing the CPU time intelligently.

Portability: Portability doesn't mean it is smaller in file size or can be carried in pen drives or memory cards. It means that it support different types of hardware.

Security: It provides security in three ways namely authenticating (by assigning password and login ID), authorization (by assigning permission to read, write and execute) and encryption (converts file into an unreadable format).

Live CD/USB: Almost all Linux distros provide live CD/USB so that users can run/try it without installing it.

Graphical User Interface (X Window system): Linux is command line based OS but it can be converted to GUI based by installing packages.

Support's customized keyboard: As it is used worldwide, hence supports different languages keyboards.

Application support: It has its own software repository from where users can download and install many applications.

File System: Provides hierarchical file system in which files and directories are arranged.
Open Source: Linux code is freely available to all and is a community based development project.
